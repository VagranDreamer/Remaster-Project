        <h2>üü•BLOCK STRUCTURE</h2>
        <br>
        <p>All mods are divided into categories, which will be very easy to navigate and make changes to your liking. For example, to organize a change of texture pack to vanilla, remove annoying faces, return old music, bodies, etc. You can install what you need from above by forming your own assembly. We advise only experienced users to do this, if you are a beginner, it is better to leave everything as it is.</p>

        <h2>üí°INSTALLATION AND REQUIREMENTS</h2>
        <br>
            <br>
            <ul><h4>Requirements:</h4>
                <li>- Pure Dragon Age: Origins [v 1.05 + all DLC]</li>
                <li>- Install <a href="https://ntcore.com/4gb-patch/" target="_blank">4GB patch</a> patch for the DAO.exe and launcher.exe files</li>
                <li>- Launch the company once and exit</li>
                </ul>
            <br>
                <ul><h4>Recommendations:</h4>
                    <li>- Graphics card GTX 1050 and above</li>
                    <li>- Do not run other background applications, disable everything including the browser</li>
                    <li>- Give DAO the highest priority in the process flow</li>
                    <li>- Do not use heavy Reshade presets</li>
                    <li>- Do not load the assembly with a large number of new 3d models and 4k textures, this will lead to instability and crashes on the desktop</li>
                    <li>- Do not play one session for more than an hour, be sure to exit the game, restart and play for the second hour, and so on. (This approach guarantees one hundred percent operability of the 4GB patch)</li>
                    <li>- Make saves more often, preferably in small stores (this guarantees one hundred percent loading of your save)</li>
                    </ul>
            <br>
            <ul><h4>The assembly consists of the following parts:</h4>
                <li>1.Core pack (the main package that is mandatory for all users)</li>
                <li>2.English pack (a package for English-speaking users)</li>
                <li>2.Russian pack (a package for Russian-speaking users)</li>
                <li>3.Video pack (required for everyone, contains videos with color correction and improved quality, they are darker and more atmospheric than usual if you prefer the vanilla version, download it <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonage/mods/5437" target="_blank">here</a>)</li>
                <li>4.Optional pack (the content is selectively placed by the user in the patch folder or replaces the existing files directly)</li>
                <li>It contains, dark robes for templars, Duncan's armor in the style of grey wardens, a kiss in the epilogue at the gate, a new look for the character selection menu, a large camp tent for sleeping, a highly polygonal head of King Kaylan, variants of the appearance of the creatures of darkness, vanilla appearance of companions)</li>
                <li>5.Reshade pack (I do not recommend installing it, but if you like to take screenshots quickly, change colors and apply filters, then take it)</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <ul><h4>Reminder:</h4>
                    <li>1.Dazip archives with mods are installed through the DAUpdater program located at C:\Games\Dragon Age Origins\bin_ship</li>
                    <li>2.Override mods are installed by moving the unzipped folders to Documents\BioWare\Dragon Age\packages\core\override</li>
                    <li>If there is no such folder, launch the game once and it will appear or create it yourself.</li>
                    <li>3.Reshade is installed by transferring files to the Dragon Age Origins\bin_ship folder</li>
                    <li>4.Do not use old saves, be sure to start a new game so that all changes take effect</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <ul><h4>ADDITIONAL OPTIMIZATION:</h4>
                        <li>1.It is recommended to install "DLC Texture Pack" in override only when you have passed the main company and decided to proceed with Awakening, Witch Hunt, Leliana's Song, The Golems of Amgarrak.</li>
                        <li>2.If that doesn't help, you should replace the textures with the 1k options, they are in the Optional Pack/Optimization</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        <ul><h4>Console:</h4>
                          <li>1.Open the KeyBindings.ini file located in the ¬´My Documents\–íi–æW–∞re\Dr–∞g–æn –êge\Settings\¬ª</li>
                          <li>2.Find the string OpenConsole_0=Keyboard::Button_Grave, replace it with OpenConsole_0=Keyboard::Button_~ save it.</li>
                          <li>3.Open the bin_ship folder in the folder with the installed game. Finding the file daorigins.exe , press the right mouse button ‚Äî> Send ‚Äî> Desktop (create a shortcut). On the desktop, find the created shortcut, click the right button ‚Äî> Properties. At the end of the "Object" field, add -enabledeveloperconsole to the path.
                            You should get the following (the path to the file may be different):
                            "–°:\Games\Dragon Age\bin_ship\daorigins.exe" -enabledeveloperconsole</li>
                          <li>Before using the console, make sure that the English keyboard (ENG) is enabled on your PC. Otherwise, the console call button will not work. To open the console in Dragon Age: Origins, use the "~" key. Enter a command from my command list and press [Enter].</li>
                          </ul>

      <h2>Questions:</h2>
      <br>
          <br>
          <h4>How do I change the appearance of my companions to vanilla?</h4>
          - Go to override, go to the Characters Faces category, replace the Companions folder with Vanilla Companions from the Optional pack.
          <br>
          <br><h4>NPC names in English this is mistake?</h4>
          - No, unfortunately, we will have to put up with this at this stage of testing.
          <br>
          <br><h4>How do I set my custom portrait?</h4>
          - You will need Photoshop and the NVIDIA Texture Tools DDS plugin or any other application for working with textures. Open the texture named tl_shared_dxt5_01 in the program. It is located in your override folder. Find an area with a circle and a griffin on a blue background on the texture (this is your character's icon), cut out and overlay your image on top of it (it should not go beyond the initial circle ‚Äî> save the texture in BC3 or BCa format ‚Äî> Replace the texture in the override folder with your own. Ready! It also works for companions.
          <br>
          <br><h4>Some characters don't have portraits. Is this a bug?</h4>
          - No, alas, it is technically impossible to make everyone a unique, hand-drawn portrait.
          <br>
          <br><h4>Is it possible to install other mods on the assembly?</h4>
          - The project uses mods from Nexus without changing model numbers, so you can install other modifications yourself by placing them in the folder "9.My mods" so they will overwrite the build files if necessary.
          <br>
          <br><h4>Will there be updates?</h4>
          - Yes, there will be updates as mods for this wonderful game are still coming out, but don't expect frequent updates.
          <br>
          <br><h4>Will there be a lighter version of the build?</h4>
          - Maybe, but after a while, I don't promise anything.
          <br>
          <br><h4>I don't like the new bright textures, can I replace them with vanilla ones?</h4>
          - Yes, of course. Change the "Retexturing full" folder to any other mod with vanilla textures. For example: <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonage/mods/5402?tab=file" target="_blank">AP Neural Enhanced Textures v4</a> + <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonage/mods/6155?tab=files" target="_blank">Manually Optimized Textures</a> + <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonage/mods/5799" target="_blank">Clean UI</a>. This action will remove the glitter of steel, my interface, portraits and icons.
          <br>
          <br><h4>How do I return the old models of swords and daggers?</h4>
          - To do this, delete the folder named Adonnay's Weapon Replacer. It is located in the overdrive folder.
          <br>
          <br><h4>I don't like NPC faces. How do I change them?</h4>
          - All faces are contained in the "5.Characters faces folder". Delete or change files to those that suit you. Characters with bright hair color are contained in the MorganLeFaye79 (bright characters) subfolder. If you are not satisfied with only them, delete the subfolder.
          <br>
          <br><h4>How to return the old armor of the creatures of darkness, without blackening and gloss?</h4>
          - Go to override/DAO Retexturing/Creatures and replace the New Darkspawn folder with the Original Darkspawn folder from the Optional Pack or use another variant. For example: blackness and shine are preserved + vanilla green faces of the darkspawn, blackness and shine are preserved + light gray faces of the darkspawn.
          <br>
          <br><h4>I have flying heads (invisible bodies), hoods and helmets are not displayed. What is it?</h4>
          - There is a small chance that this is a build flaw, send a screenshot to the discord channel and it will be fixed in the next update. But most often this happens when you start installing a bunch of mods on armor from yourself. A limited amount of armor can be added to the dao, sometimes the armor numbers match and the armor disappears or is replaced. The functionality of the assembly is guaranteed only if you use it according to the instructions and do not make critical changes yourself.</p>

            Thank you all for your works and good health to you!</b>
          <br>
          -Go to override, go to the Characters Faces category, replace the Companions folder with Vanilla Companions from the Optional pack.
          <br>
          <b>NPC names in English this is mistake?</b>
          <br>
          - No, unfortunately, we will have to put up with this at this stage of testing.
          <br>
          <b>How do I set my custom portrait?</b>
          <br>
          -You will need Photoshop and the NVIDIA Texture Tools DDS plugin or any other application for working with textures. Open the texture named tl_shared_dxt5_01 in the program. It is located in your override folder. Find an area with a circle and a griffin on a blue background on the texture (this is your character's icon), cut out and overlay your image on top of it (it should not go beyond the initial circle ‚Äî> save the texture in BC3 or BCa format ‚Äî> Replace the texture in the override folder with your own. Ready! It also works for companions.
          <br>
          <b>Some characters don't have portraits. Is this a bug?</b>
          <br>
          - No, alas, it is technically impossible to make everyone a unique, hand-drawn portrait.
          <br>
          <b>Is it possible to install other mods on the assembly?</b>
          <br>
          -The project uses mods from Nexus without changing model numbers, so you can install other modifications yourself by placing them in the folder "9.My mods" so they will overwrite the build files if necessary.
          <br>
          <b>Will there be updates?</b>
          <br>
          -Yes, there will be updates as mods for this wonderful game are still coming out, but don't expect frequent updates.
          <br>
          <b>Will there be a lighter version of the build?</b>
          <br>
          - Maybe, but after a while, I don't promise anything.
          <br>
          <b>I don't like the new bright textures, can I replace them with vanilla ones?</b>
          <br>
          - Yes, of course. Change the "Retexturing full" folder to any other mod with vanilla textures. For example: fhttps://www.nexusmods.com/dragonage/mods/5402?tab=file + https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonage/mods/6155?tab=files + https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonage/mods/5799
          <br>
          This action will remove the glitter of steel, my interface, portraits and icons. If you want to keep it, save the UI folder.
          <br>
          <b>How do I return the old models of swords and daggers?</b>
          <br>
          -To do this, delete the folder named Adonnay's Weapon Replacer. It is located in the overdrive folder.
          <br>
          <b>I don't like NPC faces. How do I change them?</b>
          <br>
          All faces are contained in the "5.Characters faces folder". Delete or change files to those that suit you. Characters with bright hair color are contained in the MorganLeFaye79 (bright characters) subfolder. If you are not satisfied with only them, delete the subfolder.
          <br>
          <b>How to return the old armor of the creatures of darkness, without blackening and gloss?</b>
          <br>
          Go to override/DAO Retexturing/Creatures to replace the New Darkspawn folder with the Original Darkspawn folder from the Optional Pack. For example: blackness and shine are preserved + vanilla green faces of the darkspawn, blackness and shine are preserved + light gray faces of the darkspawn.
          <br>
          <b>I have flying heads (invisible bodies), hoods and helmets are not displayed. What is it?</b>
          <br>
          -There is a small chance that this is a build flaw, send a screenshot to the discord channel and it will be fixed in the next update. But most often this happens when you start installing a bunch of mods on armor from yourself. A limited amount of armor can be added to the dao, sometimes the armor numbers match and the armor disappears or is replaced. The functionality of the assembly is guaranteed only if you use it according to the instructions and do not make critical changes yourself.</p>
