        <h2>üí°INSTALLATION AND REQUIREMENTS</h2>
        <br>
            <br>
            <ul><h4>Requirements:</h4>
                <li>- Pure Dragon Age: Origins [v 1.05 + all DLC]</li>
                <li>- Install <a href="https://ntcore.com/4gb-patch/" target="_blank">4GB patch</a> patch for the DAO.exe and launcher.exe files</li>
                <li>- Launch the company once and exit</li>
                </ul>
            <br>
                <ul><h4>Recommendations:</h4>
                    <li>- Graphics card GTX 1050 and above (If your graphics card is worse you can still try to play it)</li>
                    <li>- Do not run other background applications, disable everything including the browser</li>
                    <li>- Give DAO the highest priority in the process flow</li>
                    <li>- Do not use heavy Reshade presets or don't use them at all</li>
                    <li>- Do not load the assembly with a large number of new 3d models and 4k textures, this will lead to instability and crashes on the desktop</li>
                    <li>- Do not play one session for more than an hour, be sure to exit the game, restart and play for the second hour, and so on. (This approach guarantees one hundred percent operability of the 4GB patch)</li>
                    <li>- <b>How to download a save that doesn't load.</b> Restart the game ‚Üí download the save in the store or small location ‚Üí press "Esc" and download the save that you could not download before.</li>
                    </ul>
            <br>
            <ul><h4>The assembly consists of the following parts:</h4>
                <li><b>1.Core pack</b> (the main package that is mandatory for all users)</li>
                <li><b>2.English pack</b> (a package for users who speak English or other languages)</li>
                <li><b>2.Russian pack</b> + <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OoKq2Q48ooOnV7mvziKWJ4XX0AEs55mw/view" target="_blank">DAO_Extra_Mods</a> by Nalia (a packages for Russian-speaking users)</li>
                <li> Do you want more mods in Russian? Then join <a href="https://discord.gg/EMJSjgwUK8">RPGMods Discord</a>.</li>
                <li>QUADO Fixpack v3_52 - install only if you plan to play with English voice acting, if you play with Russian voice acting, use PatchFixRuDAO instead (5.Patch folder). <b>You can't use these two mods together!</b></li>
                <li><b>3.Video pack</b> - <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonage/mods/6425" target="_blank">download</a> (required for everyone, contains videos with color correction and improved quality, they are darker and more atmospheric than usual if you prefer the vanilla version, download it <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonage/mods/5437" target="_blank">here</a>)</li>
                <li><b>4.Awakening Companion's Portraits</b> (New portraits for DLC Awakening for those who use my new interface. Install only after the main company and replace the files that will be requested)</li>
                <li><b>4.DLC Texture Pack</b> (Improved textures for DLC. Install only after the main company)</li>
                <li><b>5.Patch</b> (The folder where you will need to select your patch option depending on your language)</li>
                <li><b>6.Reshade pack</b>. Install only if you use <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonage/mods/6435" target="_blank">Performance and Memory Leak Fix - DXVK</a> carefully read the requirements for this modification. A version of the Reshade with built-in DXVK is provided. You can also use the regular version of Reshade, but it will cause errors in the Denerim if you do not disable Reshade in the city.</li>
                <li><b>Optional pack</b> - <a href="https://www.mediafire.com/file/ij3328kjlxp12x1/DAO_RP_Optional.zip/file" target="_blank">download</a> (Installation is optional, the content is selectively placed by the user in the patch folder or replaces the existing files directly)</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <ul><h4>Reminder:</h4>
                    <li>1.Watch the installation video. The set of dazip and folders may vary depending on the version, but the installation principle remains the same.</li>
                    <li>2.Dazip archives with mods are installed through the DAUpdater program located at C:\Games\Dragon Age Origins\bin_ship</li>
                    <li>3.Override mods are installed by moving the unzipped folders to Documents\BioWare\Dragon Age\packages\core\override</li>
                    <li>If there is no such folder, launch the game once and it will appear or create it yourself.</li>
                    <li>4.Reshade is installed by transferring files to the Dragon Age Origins\bin_ship folder</li>
                    <li>5.Do not use old saves, be sure to start a new game so that all changes take effect</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <ul><h4>OPTIMIZATION:</h4>
                        <!-- <li>1.Read the requirements, if your system is suitable then use - <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonage/mods/6435" target="_blank">Performance and Memory Leak Fix - DXVK</a></li> -->
                        <li>1.Install "DLC Texture Pack" in override only when you have passed the main company and decided to proceed with Awakening, Witch Hunt, Leliana's Song, The Golems of Amgarrak.</li>
                        <li>2.If that doesn't help, you should replace the textures with the 1k options, they are in the Optional Pack/Optimization</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        <ul><h4>Console:</h4>
                          <li>1.Open the KeyBindings.ini file located in the ¬´My Documents\–íi–æW–∞re\Dr–∞g–æn –êge\Settings\¬ª</li>
                          <li>2.Find the string OpenConsole_0=Keyboard::Button_Grave, replace it with OpenConsole_0=Keyboard::Button_~ save it.</li>
                          <li>3.Open the bin_ship folder in the folder with the installed game. Finding the file daorigins.exe , press the right mouse button ‚Äî> Send ‚Äî> Desktop (create a shortcut). On the desktop, find the created shortcut, click the right button ‚Äî> Properties. At the end of the "Object" field, add -enabledeveloperconsole to the path.
                            You should get the following (the path to the file may be different):
                            "–°:\Games\Dragon Age\bin_ship\daorigins.exe" -enabledeveloperconsole</li>
                          <li>Before using the console, make sure that the English keyboard (ENG) is enabled on your PC. Otherwise, the console call button will not work. To open the console in Dragon Age: Origins, use the "~" key. Enter a command from my command list and press [Enter].</li>
                          <br>
                          <li>You will find all console commands in the <b>"Console Commands.txt"</b> file, a list of all mods and their authors with links to the profile and each work in the <b>"Mod List.pdf"</b> file.</li>

      <h2>New romantic scenes:</h2>
      <br>
        <h4>1.New Scenes</h4>
        <p>Adds third-party scenes that are launched when you click on an object (for example, a candlestick in Redcliffe Castle, a barrel of water in the camp, a bench, a bouquet, and others).
        Such mods do not conflict with other romance mods because they do not replace the main dialogues with the heroes (.dlg and .dlb files that are unique to each companion).</p>
          <br>
          <h4>2.Dialogues and Scenes</h4>
          <p>Mods that are built into the main dialogues, change them, or even rewrite them. They add new interaction options for you and your chosen one. When installing such a mod, you should be careful, namely, install the version only in your language so that your text does not change to English and make sure that there are no other mods in your folder that change the main dialogue with the companion, otherwise this will lead to a conflict and loss of functionality. Compatibility can be difficult to control, so I would recommend installing only one mod for your romantic interest or using the list of compatible mods.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Compatibility:</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Some mods have compatibility patches. If you have a problem installing patches, it is recommended to visit the original mod page for more information.</p>

          <br>
          <br>
          <h4>Is it possible to change the folder structure inside override?</h4>
          - No, this will lead to errors. Use a special folder for your mods "9.My mods" and the "8.Patch" folder for patches and bug fixes.
          <br>
          <br><h4>How do I change the appearance of my companions to vanilla?</h4>
          - Go to override, go to the Characters Faces category, replace the Companions folder with Vanilla Companions from the Optional pack.
          <br>
          <br><h4>How do I replace bodies with nude ones?</h4>
          - Delete the "DA 2 Body" folder from override and install the Natural Bodies folder from the Optional Pack.
          <br>
          <br><h4>NPC names in English this is mistake?</h4>
          - No, unfortunately, we will have to put up with this at this stage of testing.
          <br>
          <br><h4>How do I set my custom portrait?</h4>
          - You will need Photoshop and the NVIDIA Texture Tools DDS plugin or any other application for working with textures. Open the texture named tl_shared_dxt5_01 in the program. It is located in your override folder. Find an area with a circle and a griffin on a blue background on the texture (this is your character's icon), cut out and overlay your image on top of it (it should not go beyond the initial circle ‚Äî> save the texture in BC3 or BCa format ‚Äî> Replace the texture in the override folder with your own. Ready! It also works for companions.
          <br>
          <br><h4>Some characters don't have portraits. Is this a bug?</h4>
          - No, alas, it is technically impossible to make everyone a unique, hand-drawn portrait.
          <br>
          <br><h4>How do I get the old interface and icons back?</h4>
          - Delete the UI folder and move the Vanilla UI 4K folder from the optional package to override.
          <br>
          <br><h4>Is it possible to install other mods on the assembly?</h4>
          - The project uses mods from Nexus without changing model numbers, so you can install other modifications yourself by placing them in the folder "9.My mods" so they will overwrite the build files if necessary.
          <br>
          <br><h4>Massive armor has become smaller how to get vanilla back?</h4>
          - Delete Armor Shoulder Reduction folder.
          <br>
          <br><h4>Will there be updates?</h4>
          - Yes, there will be updates as mods for this wonderful game are still coming out, but don't expect frequent updates.
          <br>
          <br><h4>Will there be a lighter version of the build?</h4>
          - Maybe, but after a while, I don't promise anything.
          <br>
          <br><h4>I don't like the new bright textures, can I replace them with vanilla ones?</h4>
          - Yes, of course. Change the "1.Version full" folder to any other mod with vanilla textures. For example: <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonage/mods/5402?tab=file" target="_blank">AP Neural Enhanced Textures v4</a> + <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonage/mods/6155?tab=files" target="_blank">Manually Optimized Textures</a> + <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonage/mods/5799" target="_blank">Clean UI</a>. This action will remove the glitter of steel, my interface, portraits and icons.
          <br>
          <br><h4>How do I return the old models of swords and daggers?</h4>
          - To do this, delete the folder named Adonnay's Weapon Replacer. It is located in the overdrive folder.
          <br>
          <br><h4>How do I change the closed outfits of enchantresses to open ones in the vanilla style?</h4>
          - To do this, delete the folder named Tevinter Mage that placed in 2.Armor Retexture. And install Vanilla Enchanter Robes and Hoods from the Optional pack.
          <br>
          <br><h4>I don't like NPC faces. How do I change them?</h4>
          - All faces are contained in the "5.Characters faces folder". Delete or change files to those that suit you. Characters with bright hair color are contained in the MorganLeFaye79 (bright characters) subfolder. If you are not satisfied with only them, delete the subfolder.
          <br>
          <br><h4>How to bring back the vanilla green Darkspawns?</h4>
          - Go to override/DAO Retexturing/Creatures HD and replace the New Darkspawn folder with the Original Darkspawn folder from the Optional Pack or use another variant. 
          <br>
          <br><h4>I have flying heads (invisible bodies), hoods and helmets are not displayed. What is it?</h4>
          - There is a small chance that this is a build flaw, send a screenshot to the discord channel and it will be fixed in the next update. But most often this happens when you start installing a bunch of mods on armor from yourself. A limited amount of armor can be added to the dao, sometimes the armor numbers match and the armor disappears or is replaced. The functionality of the assembly is guaranteed only if you use it according to the instructions and do not make critical changes yourself.</p>
