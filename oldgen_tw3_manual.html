        <h2>💡INSTALLATION AND REQUIREMENTS</h2>
        <br>
            <br>
            <ul><h4>Requirements:</h4>
                <li>- You need a clean(without mods and reshade) Witcher 3 version 1.31/1.32 with all DLC.</li>
                <li>- Put Mod limit executable patcher.exe in the game's bin/x64 directory and run it.</li>
                <li>- Move the folders from the archive to the folder with the game and confirm the replacement of files.</li>
                <li>- Download the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/1021" target="_blank">HDReworkedProject mod</a> extract the folder from the archive and rename parts of mod to: mod_15c_HDReworkedProject1, mod_15c_HDReworkedProject2, mod_15c_HDReworkedProject3, mod_15c_HDReworkedProject4 then place it in the mods folder.</li>
                <li>- Transfer the configuration files to the Witcher 3 documents.</li>
                <li>- Launch the game, go to mods and additional content settings and turn on everything as in the screenshots of the settings. Then start your adventure.</li>
                </ul>
            <br>
                <ul><h4>Recommendations:</h4>
                    <li>- Graphics card GTX 1070 and above</li>
                    <li>- Do not run other background applications, disable everything including the browser</li>
                    <li>- Give TW3 the highest priority in the process flow</li>
                    <li>- Do not use heavy Reshade presets</li>
                    <li>- Do not load the assembly with a large number of new 3d models or lods, this will lead to fps instability</li>
                    <li>- Not using two textures of Geralt's face or eyes at the same time can lead to endless loading.
                    </li>
                    <li>- Not using a large number of modifications leads to endless loading.</li>
                    </ul>
            <br>
            <ul><h4>The assembly consists of the following parts:</h4>
                <li>1.Core pack (the main package that is mandatory for all users)</li>
                <li>2.Optional pack (the content is selectively placed by the user in the mods folder or replaces the existing files directly)</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <ul><h4>Reminder:</h4>
                    <li>1.The Witcher mods are installed by moving the unzipped folders to the mods folder.  C:\Games\The Witcher 3\mods</li>
                    <li>If there is no such folder, launch the game once and it will appear or create it yourself.</li>
                    <li>2.The mods at the top of the list overwrite the mods below. If the mod does not work, it is recommended to move it higher.</li>
                    <li>3.Some mods have required configuration files, they are moved to the bin folder.</li>
                    <li>4.There are mods that require you to replace your settings of the game itself.
                    </li>
                    <li>5.After installing a third-party mod that affects scripts you will receive an error message, it is necessary to merge conflicting files using the script merger program.This is only necessary if you have installed your mods, the build already has its own script file, so you do not need to do this.

                    </li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <ul><h4>ADDITIONAL OPTIMIZATION:</h4>
                        <li>1.For additional optimization, you can remove the following mods: mod_15c_EnvTextures_NovigradReloadedFullPackage, mod_15c_EnvTextures_E3Wall, mod_15c_EnvTextures_BeautifulRocksDark, mod_15b_HDBirds_v11, mod_2b_Graphic_MoreShadows, mod_2b_Graphic_MoreShadows_Toussaint, mod_9_Tweak_NewTorch, mod_2b_Graphic_AQUA, mod_2b_Graphic_NextGenCandles, mod_15c_EnvTextures_UHDOaksRedux_AlternateMoss, mod_15c_EnvTextures_Moon4K, mod_15c_EnvTextures_AlnusNew, mod_2b_Graphic_Snow, mod_1_0_0UltimateClouds, mod_1_0_0Rain.</li>
                        <li>2.You can delete the new shader.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        <ul><h4>Incompatible mods and other observations:</h4>
                          <li>1.Cutscenes Graphics Enhanced --- Disable Fake Lights in All Quest (the game will crash, for example, in a quest to find a friend herbalist)</li>
                          <li>2.Lip Movement and HiRes Shadows (and High Quality Heads) on NPCs in gameplay --- High Quality Faces (do the same thing, the latter disrupts the work of retextures)</li>
                          <li>3.Modular Eyes --- BeardGrowthTillStage2 (the eyes arbitrarily change the stage of beard growth and it may look different in scenes).
                          </li>
                          <li>4.TrissConceptRecolor --- TrissTW2Outfit (texture is superimposed on top)</li>
                          <li>5.BookMedallion --- ANTRMedallion (texture is superimposed on top)</li>
                          </ul>

      <h2>Questions:</h2>
      <br>
          <br>
          <h4>How do I get Geralt's vanilla face back?</h4>
          - Delete the GeraltTW2style folder or replace it with another appearance mod.
          <br>
          <br><h4>How to replace Geralt's eyes?</h4>
          - Delete the mod_000_Geralt_TW2_Eyes file and install any other options.
          <br>
          <br><h4>Where can I find new weapons and armor?</h4>
          - It can be bought in Wyzima, in the baron's castle, from master blacksmith Hattori or created according to the found drawing.

          <br>
          <br><h4>Geralt's beard is not getting long is this a bug?</h4>
          - No, a mod has been installed for the appearance of the beard and a growth stage fixator so that Geralt does not look like Santa, if you want to restore growth, delete these files: mod_8a_Beard_BeardGrowthTillStage2, mod_8a_Beard_Beard2GrowthTillStage2_for_HoSFix
          <br>
          <br><h4>How change Battle System to E3ARP?</h4>
          - When you installing E3ARP, delete the following files in the game folder: mod_3_Gameplay_SCAARAIOVengeance, dlcSCAARAIOVengeance, modscaar, modscaar.xml, modscaar.xml.bak When all new files will be located where you need to use WitcherScriptMerger to combine scripts.
          <br>
          <br><h4>Is it possible to install other mods on the assembly?</h4>
          - Yes, but don't install too much, otherwise your game won't load.
          <br>
          <br><h4>Is it possible to use additional mods for LODS?</h4>
          - Yes, you may have to play with the position of the mods in the list to make it work correctly, but this will significantly reduce your performance.
          <br>
          <br><h4>Hairstyles for women don't work. What's the matter?</h4>
          - The assembly already has vanilla hair replacers. This is: mod_8_Hairs_zzYenneferBetterHair, mod_8_Hairs_zYenHairTotalBlack, mod_8_Hairs_CiriBetterHair to change the hair you will have to remove it.
          <br>
          <br><h4>Is Hairworks for hair not working for me? Is it a bug?</h4>

            Thank you all for your works and good health to you!</b>
          <br>
          -Go to override, go to the Characters Faces category, replace the Companions folder with Vanilla Companions from the Optional pack.
          <br>
          <b>NPC names in English this is mistake?</b>
          <br>
          - No, unfortunately, we will have to put up with this at this stage of testing.
          <br>
          <b>How do I set my custom portrait?</b>
          <br>
          -You will need Photoshop and the NVIDIA Texture Tools DDS plugin or any other application for working with textures. Open the texture named tl_shared_dxt5_01 in the program. It is located in your override folder. Find an area with a circle and a griffin on a blue background on the texture (this is your character's icon), cut out and overlay your image on top of it (it should not go beyond the initial circle —> save the texture in BC3 or BCa format —> Replace the texture in the override folder with your own. Ready! It also works for companions.
          <br>
          <b>Some characters don't have portraits. Is this a bug?</b>
          <br>
          - No, alas, it is technically impossible to make everyone a unique, hand-drawn portrait.
          <br>
          <b>Is it possible to install other mods on the assembly?</b>
          <br>
          -The project uses mods from Nexus without changing model numbers, so you can install other modifications yourself by placing them in the folder "9.My mods" so they will overwrite the build files if necessary.
          <br>
          <b>Will there be updates?</b>
          <br>
          -Yes, there will be updates as mods for this wonderful game are still coming out, but don't expect frequent updates.
          <br>
          <b>Will there be a lighter version of the build?</b>
          <br>
          - Maybe, but after a while, I don't promise anything.
          <br>
          <b>I don't like the new bright textures, can I replace them with vanilla ones?</b>
          <br>
          - Yes, of course. Change the "Retexturing full" folder to any other mod with vanilla textures. For example: fhttps://www.nexusmods.com/dragonage/mods/5402?tab=file + https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonage/mods/6155?tab=files + https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonage/mods/5799
          <br>
          This action will remove the glitter of steel, my interface, portraits and icons. If you want to keep it, save the UI folder.
          <br>
          <b>How do I return the old models of swords and daggers?</b>
          <br>
          -To do this, delete the folder named Adonnay's Weapon Replacer. It is located in the overdrive folder.
          <br>
          <b>I don't like NPC faces. How do I change them?</b>
          <br>
          All faces are contained in the "5.Characters faces folder". Delete or change files to those that suit you. Characters with bright hair color are contained in the MorganLeFaye79 (bright characters) subfolder. If you are not satisfied with only them, delete the subfolder.
          <br>
          <b>How to return the old armor of the creatures of darkness, without blackening and gloss?</b>
          <br>
          Go to override/DAO Retexturing/Creatures to replace the New Darkspawn folder with the Original Darkspawn folder from the Optional Pack. For example: blackness and shine are preserved + vanilla green faces of the darkspawn, blackness and shine are preserved + light gray faces of the darkspawn.
          <br>
          <b>I have flying heads (invisible bodies), hoods and helmets are not displayed. What is it?</b>
          <br>
          -There is a small chance that this is a build flaw, send a screenshot to the discord channel and it will be fixed in the next update. But most often this happens when you start installing a bunch of mods on armor from yourself. A limited amount of armor can be added to the dao, sometimes the armor numbers match and the armor disappears or is replaced. The functionality of the assembly is guaranteed only if you use it according to the instructions and do not make critical changes yourself.</p>
